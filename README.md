CoreDataEmployment
==================

A simple Department/Employee app to demonstrate using Core Data. Through this project, we will learn how to...

- setup a basic Core Data stack
- create a data model 
- create custom `NSManagedObject` classes from the data model
- create managed object instances and save them
- search for particular entries
- list our data in a table view using `NSFetchedResultsController`
- use mogenerator for better class file generation
- time permitting, see how `NSFetchedResultsController` works under the hood
